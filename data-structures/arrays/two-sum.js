//Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers
//such that they add up to target.
//You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the
//same element twice.
//Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?
